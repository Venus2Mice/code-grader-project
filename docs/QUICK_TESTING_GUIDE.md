## üêõ Debugging Tips

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Solution:** Check that backend is running on port 5000

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Token expired or invalid. Logout and login again.

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Backend should have CORS enabled for localhost:3000

### Issue: Page shows "Not found"
**Solution:** Check URL and ensure ID exists in database

### Issue: Empty arrays returned
**Solution:** 
- Check database has data
- Verify user has permission to access resource
- Check API endpoint in Network tab

### Issue: Backend returns 500 error
**Solution:** Check backend console for error details

## üîç Database Verification

After testing, verify data in database:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -d code_grader

# Check tables
\dt

# Verify users created
SELECT id, email, full_name FROM "user";

# Verify classes created
SELECT id, name, course_code FROM class;

# Verify problems created
SELECT id, title, class_id FROM problem;

# Verify test cases
SELECT id, problem_id, points, is_hidden FROM test_case;

# Verify submissions
SELECT id, user_id, problem_id, status, score FROM submission;
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

- [ ] Register teacher account
- [ ] Register student account
- [ ] Login with both accounts
- [ ] Teacher creates class
- [ ] Student joins class
- [ ] Teacher creates problem with test cases
- [ ] Student views problem
- [ ] Student submits solution
